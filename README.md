# churn_prediction
Task 1 is done in eda.ipynb and feature engineering for model building.
Task 2 is dine in churn_pred.ipynb
To run both the notebooks go from top down approach cell by cell.
The notebook contains the output of the run. Incase if it needs to be run, replace the path for challenge_dataset in eda.ipynb (uploaded in git), which inturn will create challenge_dataset and final_challenge_dataset.
Incase if the model needs to run directly replace final_challenge_dataset path in churn_pred.ipynb
